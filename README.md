# SED_keywords_maker

For starters ... I tried to use as many static fields as possible. 
I did it a little for fun and a little practice. 
I wrote a second version of this app which uses objectivity. 
There is a SED_keywords_maker_V2 repository.

It is an application that creates keyword and keyword pairs. 
The source of the word and configuration data is file. 
The application reads several hundred thousand words from the file, 
creates pairs of them and sends them to the database. 
You must have a database and tables created. 
The application does not do this. 
The result of the application is nearly 4,500,000 words. 
One pair is formed in approximately 0.003 seconds.
